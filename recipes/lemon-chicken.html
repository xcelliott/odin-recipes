    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This healthy baked lemon chicken always turns out well, from the first recipe test to the last time I 
        made it (last night!)! It is juicy, tender, and savory with just the slightest hint of sweetness. 
        Plus, it’s super simple to make. Serve it with pan-roasted garlic asparagus and some air fryer 
        potatoes for an easy, well-rounded meal. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>boneless skinless chicken breasts</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste , (I used 1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper)</li>
        <li>optional: fresh rosemary and lemon slices for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and grease a baking sheet or large casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook chicken 2-3 
            minutes on each side just until browned. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl whisk together chicken broth, lemon juice, honey, garlic, Italian seasoning, 
            and salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Pour sauce over chicken. Bake 20-30 minutes (closer to 20 for smaller chicken breasts, closer 
            to 30 for larger) until chicken is cooked through. Every 5-10 minutes spoon the sauce from the 
            pan over the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh rosemary and lemon slices if desired and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>For the Chicken: this recipe also works well with chicken thighs. I recommend medium size, boneless. 
        If you are using skin-on, be sure to brown them in a skillet over medium-high heat first, 1-2 minutes 
        on each side.
